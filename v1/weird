maybe argv[0] is needed for UNIX compat
	currently []Value is passed without head
wanted to do
	builtins[String("let-set")] = Ptr(MakeClosure("let [get 0]; set [get 0] [get 1]"))
	but realized that it won't work since let will create binding in wrong frame
	can't do [
		let-set f [up {frame}]
		let-frame [get f] [get 0]
		set-frame [get f] [get 0] [get 1]
	] since {frame} is a closure and they don't accept frame
	needs dynamic scoping like "this"

	maybe () to not create frame?

	let let-set
	set let-set (
		let [get 0]
		set [get 0] [get 1]
	)
	let-set

	let let2
	set let2 {

	}
	[
		let2 foo
	]
	set foo 3 # Must halt.

	import # Also introduces bindings...
