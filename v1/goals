2023 8 28 2 32 add builtins as values
	already have closures, can reuse
	need to give proper frame to top main.go:/^func Evaluate/ and
	make builtins functions

	status: in progress

2023 8 29 make builtins more transparent
	[let-set x 3] is too convenient
	other ideas: pass [here] frame explicitly: [let-set [here] x 3]
		verbose
	call without creating a new frame: (let-set x 3)
		toplevel problem, should it default to [] or ()
		probably (). then wrap in "value [...]" all blocks, which is hmm
		alternatively, default to [] but make set work for globals
		[set foo 3]
